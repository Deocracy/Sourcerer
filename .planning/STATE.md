# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-08-19)

**Core value:** A daily-drivable IDE whose substrate is a real browser (DRM, WebExtensions, site isolation inherited from Firefox), built so every later plan lands as an addition, never a rework.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Build Infrastructure

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Build Infrastructure)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-08-20 — Roadmap created, 26/26 v1 requirements mapped

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Nix flake is its own phase (not folded into 2/3) — the NixOS Firefox toolchain is the project's highest unknown and blocks both tracks
- Roadmap: research's 7 phases compressed to 5 (standard granularity) — xhtml gut + TheiaService merged into Phase 4; both are "the window shows Theia"
- Roadmap: UI hints suppressed on all phases — CLAUDE.md forbids GUI work beyond the rename in v4.0

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1: nixpkgs Firefox-toolchain attributes are unverified. Check every attribute against the nixos MCP before writing the flake (research STACK.md gap).
- Phase 4: verify the pinned Theia release is >= 1.73.1 and that the CVE-2026-61891 token check fires on plain HTTP, not only WebSocket upgrade.
- All phases: Theia has no API stability tier. Review every `@theia/*` import against `doc/Migration.md` and record it in INTERNAL-APIS.md.

# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-06)

**Core value:** A pixel-perfect, fully interactive desktop shell where the applet framework demonstrably works end-to-end — Notes proves the loop, every other applet is a believable stub.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — shell-foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (shell-foundation) — EXECUTING
Plan: 3 of 3
Status: Ready to execute

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Tauri 2 + React 18.2.0 + Vite + TS, no component library; pixel-perfect bespoke design.
- [Init]: Notes is the only real applet in v1; all others are high-fidelity stubs.
- [Init]: Databasise integration mode and host.ai() backend deliberately deferred — seams preserved, stubbed in v1.
- [Roadmap]: Persistence split into its own phase (Phase 3) — crash-safety + schema versioning is a distinct critical-risk subsystem per PITFALLS.md.
- [Phase ?]: 01-02: title bar wired to Tauri window API; maximize state via isMaximized()-on-onResized, stateless (D-02)
- [Phase ?]: 01-02: verify:fonts node gate proves SHELL-04 (no Google Fonts, local IBM Plex bundled)

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 7 added (2026-07-07): Assistant Harness Core — real headless Pi sidecar behind host.ai(). Pulls "Real backend behind host.ai()" forward from the v2 deferral. Standalone, depends on Phase 1 only, buildable in parallel with Phases 2–5. De-risked by spikes 001–005.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 2 research flag]: Prototype pointer-event pattern + React 18 StrictMode-safe port strategy needs deep planning research before spec.
- [Phase 1 verify]: Confirm PerMonitorV2 DPI awareness so 1px borders hold at 125%/150% scaling.
- [Scaffold]: Verify Databasise's `cargo run` vs `cargo tauri dev` launch landmine does not reproduce in a fresh scaffold.

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and carried forward from previous milestone close:

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Integration | Databasise engine (live Wiki/Library/Graph data) | Deferred to v2 | Init |
| AI | Real backend behind host.ai() | Deferred to v2 | Init |
| Applets | All applets beyond Notes (stubs only) | Deferred to later milestones | Init |
| Packaging | Installer / shipping-form polish | Deferred | Init |
